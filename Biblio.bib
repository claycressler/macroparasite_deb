@article{Hamilton2008,
abstract = {Parasites represent a major threat to all organisms which has led to the evolution of an array of complex and effective defence mechanisms. Common to both vertebrates and invertebrates are innate immune mechanisms that can be either constitutively expressed or induced on exposure to infection. In nature, we find that a combination of both induced and constitutive responses are employed by vertebrates, invertebrates and, to an extent, plants when they are exposed to a parasite. Here we use a simple within-host model motivated by the insect immune system, consisting of both constitutive and induced responses, to address the question of why both types of response are maintained so ubiquitously. Generally, induced responses are thought to be advantageous because they are only used when required but are too costly to maintain constantly, while constitutive responses are advantageous because they are always ready to act. However, using a simple cost function but with no a priori assumptions about relative costs, we show that variability in parasite growth rates selects for a strategy that combines both constitutive and induced defences. Differential costs are therefore not necessary to explain the adoption of both forms of defence. Clearly, hosts are likely to be challenged by variable parasites in nature and this is sufficient to explain why it is optimal to deploy both arms of the innate immune system.},

@article{Alizon2005,
abstract = {Most models of virulence evolution assume that a parasite cannot raise its transmission rate without causing more harm to its host. However, the existence of such trade-off relationships has recently been challenged. Here, we study how a trade-off can emerge from a model that explicitly incorporates within-host dynamics. We find that the existence and the convexity of the trade-off are robust, which implies a definite level of evolutionarily stable virulence (ESV) for the parasite. However, we also show that the dependence of the ESV on parameter values may be very strong. One possible consequence of this sensitivity is that relationships between transmission and virulence observed across populations need not conform to the patterns expected on the basis of a common (fixed) trade-off. We discuss possible experiments and implications of our results for the development of virulence management strategies.},

@article{Fenton2006,
abstract = {Current analytical models of the mammalian immune system typically assume a specialist predator-prey relationship between invading pathogens and the active components of the immune response. However, in reality, the specific immune system is not immediately effective following invasion by a novel pathogen. First, there may be an explicit time delay between infection and immune initiation and, second, there may be a gradual build-up in immune efficacy (for instance, during the period of B-cell affinity maturation) during which the immune response develops, before reaching maximal specificity to the pathogen. Here, we use a novel theoretical approach to show that these processes, together with the presence of long-lived immune memory, decouple the immune response from current pathogen levels, greatly changing the dynamics of the pathogen-immune system interaction and the ability of the immune response to eliminate the pathogen. Furthermore, we use this model to show how distributed primary immune responses combine with immune memory to greatly affect the optimal virulence of the pathogen, potentially resulting in the evolution of highly virulent pathogens.},

@article{Wiegel2004,
abstract = {Using recent progress in biological scaling, we explore the way in which the immune system of an animal scales with its mass (M). It is shown that the number of cells in a single clone of B cells should scale as M and that the B-cell repertoire scales as ln (cM), where c is a constant. The time that a B cell needs to circulate once through the organism is shown to scale as M(1/4)ln (cM). It is suggested that the scaling of other cell populations in the immune system could be derived from these scaling relations for B cells.},

@article{Nunn2003,
abstract = {In primates, baseline levels of white blood cell (WBC) counts are related to mating promiscuity. It was hypothesized that differences in the primate immune system reflect pathogen risks from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Here, we test for the generality of this result by examining hypotheses involving behavioural, ecological and life-history factors in carnivores. Again, we find a significant correlation in carnivores between mating promiscuity and elevated levels of WBC counts. In addition, we find relationships with measures of sociality, substrate use and life-history parameters. These comparative results across independent taxonomic orders indicate that the evolution of the immune system, as represented by phylogenetic differences in basal levels of blood cell counts, is closely linked to disease risk involved with promiscuous mating and associated variables. We found only limited support for an association between the percentage of meat in the diet and WBC counts, which is consistent with the behavioural and physiological mechanisms that carnivores use to avoid parasite transmission from their prey. We discuss additional comparative questions related to taxonomic differences in disease risk, modes of parasite transmission and implications for conservation biology.},
