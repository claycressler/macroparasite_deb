abstract = {Using recent progress in biological scaling, we explore the way in which the immune system of an animal scales with its mass (M). It is shown that the number of cells in a single clone of B cells should scale as M and that the B-cell repertoire scales as ln (cM), where c is a constant. The time that a B cell needs to circulate once through the organism is shown to scale as M(1/4)ln (cM). It is suggested that the scaling of other cell populations in the immune system could be derived from these scaling relations for B cells.},

@article{Nunn2003,
abstract = {In primates, baseline levels of white blood cell (WBC) counts are related to mating promiscuity. It was hypothesized that differences in the primate immune system reflect pathogen risks from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Here, we test for the generality of this result by examining hypotheses involving behavioural, ecological and life-history factors in carnivores. Again, we find a significant correlation in carnivores between mating promiscuity and elevated levels of WBC counts. In addition, we find relationships with measures of sociality, substrate use and life-history parameters. These comparative results across independent taxonomic orders indicate that the evolution of the immune system, as represented by phylogenetic differences in basal levels of blood cell counts, is closely linked to disease risk involved with promiscuous mating and associated variables. We found only limited support for an association between the percentage of meat in the diet and WBC counts, which is consistent with the behavioural and physiological mechanisms that carnivores use to avoid parasite transmission from their prey. We discuss additional comparative questions related to taxonomic differences in disease risk, modes of parasite transmission and implications for conservation biology.},
